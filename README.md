# ebpf-hpc

I'm trying to create a development environment for ebpf programs that can be ported into Kubernetes.
I am trying to start with examples from [cilium/ebpf](https://github.com/cilum/ebpf) and then use the "bpfman"
(BPF manager) in Kubernetes to run there. If I can make that simple connection, plus have a developer container
here that can build, we should be good to start testing ideas.
